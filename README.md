# Spam Email Classification using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorization

# Dataset Overview

Dataset: Loaded a dataset containing email messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam).

# Preprocessing:

Cleaned and preprocessed the text data by converting to lowercase, removing URLs, special characters, numbers, single characters, and stopwords.

# Data Visualization

Distribution: Visualized the distribution of spam and ham messages using count plots and pie charts.

Word Clouds: Created word clouds to visualize frequent words in both spam and ham messages.

# Feature Extraction

TF-IDF Vectorization: Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

# Model Building

Logistic Regression: Implemented and trained a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF features.

# Model Evaluation

Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets (around 96.9% and 96.8% respectively).

# Example Testing

Example Emails: Demonstrated the model's predictions on example emails, correctly identifying spam and ham emails based on their content.
